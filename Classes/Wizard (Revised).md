# Wizard (Revised)

## **Wizard**'s spellbook

### Adding spells

You can copy spells from scrolls and other spellbooks, regardless who wrote them.

Adding a spell from a foreign source (that is a scroll or a spellbook not written by you) takes 4 hours times the spell's level, 1 hour for cantrips. It also requires you to use specially prepared ink. The ink's preparation process **is already included** as part of adding the spell. Your character, however, must be able to prepare the ink.

**Remark:** You don't need to add known cantrips to your spellbook, as you can always cast them. However, if it so happens that you come across a written version of a cantrip that is not on the known spell list, you might want to store it for later so that you can learn it - this is done through adding it to the spellbook.

A wizard is able to prepare gem-based ink from basic ink and gemdust related to the spell's element by default and they would never fail at this trivial task. However, some spells require additional material components, which have to be mixed into the ink as well, regardless if the spell consumes the components or not. This might seldom require a Craftsmanship check, especially if the conditions aren't friendly (for example: traversing the Infernal Plane vs sitting in a proper lab), although it will be expected that you come up with a creative way to add potentially difficult reagents to the mixture.

The gemdust to ink ratio in the mixture will vary depending on the spell's level, quadratically increasing the value of gemdust required for the process. The values are as follows:

| Spell level | How many gp worth of gemdust |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0           | 5                            |
| 1           | 10                           |
| 2           | 40                           |
| 3           | 100                          |
| 4           | 180                          |
| 5           | 300                          |
| 6           | 430                          |
| 7           | 600                          |
| 8           | 780                          |
| 9           | 1000                         |

### Copying your own spellbook

You can copy spells from your own spellbook, which only takes 30 minutes for every spell level (10 minutes for cantrips). You still need to expand the same amount of resources, though.

## Arcane Tradition: Lore Mastery (Revised)

### Lore Mastery (2nd level)

- You gain expertise in a number of knowledge-related skills equal to your Intelligence modifier, with a minimum of 1. You must have proficiency in a skill in order to select it for this feature.
- You can roll Intelligence for Initiative rather than Dexterity.

### Spell Secrets (2nd level)

You can alter existing spells in a few ways.

#### Different saving throw

Once between rests you can change the type of the saving throw related to a spell being cast. 

Doing this on the fly is very difficult, therefore can only pull it off once in a while.

#### Spell variations

You are able to create variations of existing spells. Those variations count as separate spells and therefore have to be prepared separately from the parent spell. When modifying a spell, you can either try to modify it within the same element(s), or change the element as well.

##### Same element

Modifying a spell within the same set of elements allows you to change the damage type to one of those assigned to either of the elements from that set.

In this case, you don't have to write the modified spell in your spellbook. The changes are small enough for you to remember them by heart. However, you still need to memorize the spell separately.

##### Different elements

When you're changing the used elements, you need to write the modified spell down in the spellbook, as it will require a different type of ink. It's a normal process of adding a spell, except it takes twice the time.

Changing the elements behind the spell might be a serious modification that might influence the entire effect of the spell and even change the saving throws. Simple offensive spells will usually not be altered that much, but more complex ones will likely have to be discussed.

##### Elemental damage types

| Element         | Damage types                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Fire**        | fire, radiant, lightning                 |
| **Earth**       | bludgeoning, acid, force                 |
| **Light**       | fire, radiant, lightning                 |
| **Death**       | cold, necrotic, poison                   |
| **Darkness**    | slashing, piercing, shadow, poison, acid |
| **Aether**      | ethereal, force, sonic                   |
| **Air**         | cold, lightning, force, sonic            |
| **Water**       | slashing, bludgeoning, cold, acid        |
| **Demonology*** | fire, cold, necrotic, shadow             |

<sup>*Technically, Demonology is not an element, but rather a type of magic that combines various elements.</sup>

### Alchemical Casting (6th level)

You learn to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell with a spell slot, you can expend one additional spell slot to augment its effects for this casting, imbuing the spell with additional energy derived from the given circle. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.

An additional **1st-level spell slot** can increase the spell’s raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase the damage against every target by 2d10 force damage. If the spell can deal damage on more than one turn, it deals this extra force damage only on the turn you cast the spell.

An additional **2nd-level spell slot** can increase the spell’s range. If the spell’s range is at least 30 feet, it becomes 1 mile. If the spell's range is below 30 feet, it becomes 30 feet.

An additional **3rd-level spell slot** can increase the spell’s potency. Increase the spell’s save DC by 2.

### Prodigious Memory (10th level)

You have attained a greater mastery of spell preparation. Once between rests, as a bonus action, you can replace one spell you have prepared with another spell from your spellbook.

Moreover, you now no longer have to create separate spells when changing the damage type without changing the elements. You can do it on the fly the number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier per day.

### Master of Magic (14th level)

Your knowledge of magic allows you to duplicate almost any spell. Once per day, as a bonus action, you can call to mind the ability to cast one spell of your choice from any class’s spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, you mustn’t have it prepared, and you follow the normal rules for casting it, including expending a spell slot. If the spell isn’t a wizard spell, it counts as a wizard spell when you cast it. The ability to cast the spell vanishes from your mind when you cast it or when the current turn ends.

You can also use this feature as an action after the enemy casts a spell instead. You then make an Arcana check in attempt to identify the spell, with the DC equal to 15 + the spell's level. If you succeed, you can later attempt to recreate the spell (this takes twice the time of normal spell addition). The spell is fresh in your memory until the next long rest. Past that point, you need to make an Intelligence check in order to recall the details, against the DC of 10 + twice the number of long rests since identifying the spell. On a failure, you forget the spell, however you keep the progress achieved up to this point (in hours). On a success, you can continue the process.

## Arcane Tradition: Dread Magic

While the arcane school of Necromancy allows one to manipulate life, death and undeath, the Dread Magi research ancient, forbidden techniques that increase that control tenfold. However, it doesn't come without a price to pay...

### Restriction: Undead Only

Only undead can choose the Dread Magic arcane tradition.

Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. In the world of Northland, however, all Dread Magi are undead. While there exist other, both living *and* undead creatures that utilize Black Magic, they are very few and they aren't classified as Dread Magi, using an entirely different approach to achieve this kind of power.

Alternatively, your DM can allow you to begin as a living creature and only turn undead at the 14th level.

### Speech of Horror (2nd level)

You can speak, read and write in **Black Speech**. Whenever you speak this language, you have advantage on **Intimidation** checks.

### Wizard's Grimoire (2nd level)

All the spells in your spellbook are now written in **Black Speech**. Moreover, you can now add **Black Magic** spells into your spellbook.

The DC of all **Black Magic** spells you cast is your normal spell DC increased by **3**. Moreover, Black Magic spells ignore necrotic damage resistances of all creatures, except undead, and they generally deal more damage or have much more powerful effects than a typical arcane spell of the same level would.

In return, whenever you cast a Black Magic spell, you risk **permanently** losing a part of your **Wisdom** score, which cannot be regained through spells that normally remove that type of effects. You have to make Wisdom saving throw against the DC equal to:

<center><b>13 + the level of the spell being cast</b>.</center>

On a failure you are sapped an amount of Wisdom equal to the spell's **Insanity Risk** value, provided in the description. That saving throw is a **Corruption** saving throw.

Losing **Wisdom** this way sees your character slowly being driven insane and toward **evil** by the corruption. If your Wisdom reaches the score of **0** through this effect, your character becomes completely **corrupted**. They regain a score of **10 Wisdom**, but they also become **Evil** (if they aren't already) and you completely and permanently **lose control** of them, as they become consumed by their hunger for power, turning hostile toward everyone, seeking to make everybody a mindless husk under their control.

### Deterrent Incantation (6th level)

You learn arcane techniques that let you oppose the corruption more effeciently.

Whenever you cast a Black Magic spell, you can expend an additional spell slot of the same level. If you do so, you make the Corruption saving throw with advantage.

### Ravenous Incantation (6th level)

In face of great adversity, and if there is no other way, you know how to harness the Black Arts even without any arcane energy left, by voluntarily sacrificing a part of yourself.

Whenever you cast a Black Magic spell, you can do so without expanding a spell slot, as long as the spell is of a level of which you have spell slots. If you do so, you get no saving throw against the corruption, and you suffer the ability score sap as if you had failed.

### The Dreadful Don't Kneel (10th level)

You become proficient in Charisma saving throws and are immune to mind control, including the effects that specifically affect undead, such as *Turn Undead*.

### Conduit of Corruption (14th level)

You have already been corrupted by Black Magic, but you have managed to seize control of the corruption and embrace your insanity. It will take significantly more vile energy to push you through yet another threshold.

Whenever you have to make a Corruption saving throw, you can change the targeted ability. If you do so, you instead make the saving throw with the ability of your choice and on a failure, the score of *that* ability is sapped. The ability you choose must be different than the ability that was the initial target (generally Wisdom).

If you see your ability score sapped after failing a save for which you have used this feature, the sap becomes **temporary** rather than permanent. Whenever you take a long rest, you can revoke a point of sap attached to one of your abilities. This is the only way for you to remove this effect.
