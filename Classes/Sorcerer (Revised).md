*Fire* is used for the Efreeti and the Desire Demon, *Light* for the Angel and *Aether* for the Djinni.

If the Desire Demon is your ancestor, you also gain the same benefit for *Demonology* spells.

### Unearthly Characteristic (14th level)

You learn how to administer your ancestor's innate abilities to a certain degree.

As a bonus action, you can partially change your form, to gain the following benefit(s):

| Ancestor               | Benefit                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fire elemental**     | ***Lesser Fire Form.*** You can **amorphously** move through spaces as narrow as **1 foot wide** and can end your turn in another creature's space. Whenever a creature touches or hits you, or starts its turn in the same space as you, it takes **fire damage** equal to your **Charisma modifier**. You also produce light (10/20 ft). |
| **Earth elemental**    | ***Lesser Earth Glide.*** You can **burrow** through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing the material you move through. You can stay burrowed for a number of rounds equal to your **Charisma modifier**. After that, you are treated as out of breath and start choking. |
| **Angel**              | ***Angel's Wings.*** You sprout a pair of wings from your back, gaining a **flying speed** equal to your current speed. Moreover, you shed light (30/60 ft). |
| **Darkness elemental** | ***Lesser Umbral Form.*** You can **amorphously** move through spaces as narrow as **1 foot wide** and can end your turn in another creature's space. As long as a creature is in the same space as you, it's blinded. Moreover, in dim light or complete darkness, you can move along any surfaces, like walls and ceilings. |
| **Djinni**             | ***Twisting Fate.*** You start to hover up to a few inches above the ground, as an arcane whirlwind begins to replace your legs. As a **reaction** to a creature making an attack roll, an ability check or a saving throw, you can spend **2 Sorcery points** to roll **d4** and apply the number rolled as a **bonus** or **penalty** to the creature's roll. You do so after the creature rolls, but before any effects of the roll occur. Moreover, whenever you cast a spell in this form, there is a **10% chance** for a **wild magic surge**. If it occurs, you roll for the effect twice and pick the preferred result. |
| **Air elemental**      | ***Lesser Air Form.*** You can **amorphously** move through spaces as narrow as **1 foot wide** and can end your turn in another creature's space. Moreover, your speed increases by 5 feet, and you gain a flying speed equal to your current speed. |
| **Water elemental**    | ***Lesser Water Form.*** You can **amorphously** move through spaces as narrow as **1 foot wide** and can end your turn in another creature's space. You can also **breathe underwater** for an additional number of **minutes** equal to your **Charisma value**. |
| **Efreeti**            | ***Disrupting Fate.*** You start to hover up to a few inches above the ground, as an infernal whirlwind begins to replace your legs. As a **reaction** to a creature making an attack roll, an ability check or a saving throw, you can spend **2 Sorcery points** to roll **d4** and apply the number rolled as a **penalty** to the creature's roll. You do so after the creature rolls, but before any effects of the roll occur. Moreover, you gain **+1 dodge AC**, and get advantage on **Deception** checks. |
| **Desire demon**       | ***Two-Faced.*** You *either* get **advantage** on **Persuasion** and **Deception** checks, and the ability to cast **Charm Person** at will at **1st level**, provided that the target can potentially be attracted to a person of your gender, *or* you get advantage on **Intimidation** checks and sprout a pair of demonic wings, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. |

The form can be dismissed as a bonus action or when your character gets knocked out.

### Mystical Resistance (20th level)

Once per day, if you fail a saving throw, you can re-roll it, this time adding your Charisma modifier. If it's already a Charisma save, add your modifier a second time.

#### Greater Elemental Affinity

You can now spend 5 Sorcery Points rather than 1, to activate a more powerful, but shorter version of *Elemental Affinity*. For the next minute, instead of gaining resistances from this feature, you gain immunities. Moreover, whenever within that duration you also have your *Unearthly Characteristic* active, you gain the following benefit:

| Ancestor               | Benefit                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fire elemental**     | Your **Planar Might** bonus is **doubled**. You also gain **resistance** on all checks against **effects restricting** your movement. |
| **Earth elemental**    | You become proficient in **Strength** saving throws. You also become **immune** to being knocked **prone** and being otherwise hurled by various effects. |
| **Angel**              | Your flying speed is doubled. Once per turn, you can deal extra radiant damage equal to your level to one target, whenever you deal any damage. |
| **Darkness elemental** | You become proficient in **Dexterity** saving throws. You become **immune** to being paralyzed or poisoned. Moreover, if you were to receive **shadow** or **poison** damage if it wasn't for your immunity, you gain that number of temporary hit points for the duration instead. |
| **Djinni**             | You become proficient in **Intelligence** saving throws. Your **wild magic surge** chance is now **20%**. Whenever you cast a spell, there is a **50% chance** you regain **1 Sorcery Point** (this can only activate once per turn). |
| **Air elemental**      | You become proficient in **Dexterity** saving throws and gain **resistance** on all checks against **effects restricting** your movement. |
| **Water elemental**    | You become proficient in **Wisdom** saving throws and gain **resistance** on all checks against **effects restricting** your movement. |
| **Efreeti**            | You become proficient in **Intelligence** saving throws. Whenever you deal damage, there is a **50% chance** you regain **1 Sorcery Point** (this can only activate once per turn). |
| **Desire demon**       | Your flying speed is doubled. Your **fire** spells deal **hellfire** damage instead. |

## Sorcerous Origin: Roaring Rampage (Revised)

Your spells are of **magical** source.

### Exceptional

You get to pick a color. All of your spells are partially tinted according to that choice. Moreover, your eyes glow that color with varied strength whenever you cast spells or use your origin features.

### Expanded Spell List

You have access to the **Thaumaturgy** cantrip for free.

You also gain the option to learn the following spells, which count as part of your Sorcerer spell list:

| Circle | Spells             |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| 5th    | Maelstrom          |
| 7th    | Fire Storm         |
| 8th    | Earthquake         |
| 9th    | Storm of Vengeance |

### A Hail of Emotions (1st Level)

You get **advantage** on **Charisma** checks. You get **disadvantage** on **Composure** checks *not related* to the features of this origin.

Whenever your characters feels strong emotion outside of a fight, the DM might prompt you to make a **Composure** check. 

On a failure, roll a d12. The following effect occurs, depending on the result:

| d12   | Consequence                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | You cast **Fireball** centered on yourself.                  |
| 2     | You cast **Sleet Storm** centered on yourself, as your emotions slowly build up in your voice. |
| 3     | You cast **Shatter** centered on a fragile object of your choice within 60 ft. |
| 4     | You cast **Shatter** centered on yourself.                   |
| 5     | You cast **Cold Nova** centered on yourself. If your character is afraid, cast **Burning Hands** instead, targeted toward the source of the fear. |
| 6-7   | You cast **Thunderwave** centered on yourself.               |
| 8-9   | You cast **Thunderclap**. If your character is afraid, cast **Shield** instead. |
| 10-12 | You cast **Thaumaturgy** up to **d4** times over the next 30 seconds, causing a different effect each time. |

On a **critical failure**, you additionally cast **Control Weather**, causing it to rain heavily and storm, with the effect taking place almost immediately.

You don't need to know the specified spells in order for them to be cast through this feature. Moreover, whenever you are forced to cast a spell this way, you don't lose your spell slots and don't need to use any components. If the spell deals damage, it doesn't hurt *you*.

You can voluntarily fail the check, in which case you are free to select which spells are released by your character as a manifestation of their rage. If the DM rules your selection inappropriate (for example: *mage armor* or *cure wounds* (unless targeted at an undead) doesn't quite represent a sudden urge to cause destruction), they might have you roll the d12 instead, except you get to roll twice and select either result.

### Unleash (1st level)

Once per day, as a bonus action, you can enter a rage-like state for 1 minute. You cannot use this feature if you have used *Suppress* earlier that same day.

While in this state:

* You gain your level as temporary hit points.
* Your spells are of **supernatural** source, meaning they ignore close to all resistances and immunities. They are now *completely* tinted with your Exceptional color.
* All the numerical values of your spells' effects represented by dice rolls are increased by one die tier (for example: **d6** instead of **d4**).
* You *cannot* cast spells of the **Enchantment (Charm)** sub-school.
* You *cannot* target another creature with a buffing spell, be it directly or indirectly (through area-of-effect).

After this state ends, you gain an exhaustion level and additionally cannot use *Suppress* for the rest of the day.

### Suppress (1st level)

Once per day, as a bonus action, or when the effect of *A Hail of Emotions* is about to take place, you can suppress your power for the rest of the day. You cannot use this feature if you have used *Unleash* earlier that same day.

If you have used that feature, until the next long rest:

* You are unusually calm, and you have **advantage** on all **Composure** checks.
* You are **proficient** in **Wisdom** saving throws.
* You use **Wisdom** as your spellcasting ability rather than Charisma.
* All of the effects of *A Hail of Emotions* are disabled.
* You *cannot* use metamagic modifiers other than *Careful*, *Extended*, *Quiet*, *Subtle*.
* You *cannot* use *Unleash*.

### Remarkable Willpower (6th level)

Whenever you're under the effect of either *Unleash* or *Suppress*, you have advantage on saving throws against fear, charm and compulsion.

### Supernatural Metamagic (14th level)

You can now combine two metamagic modifiers together. If you are under the effect of the *Suppress* feature while doing this, the total cost of the combined metamagic is decreased by **1 Sorcery Point**.

You can also learn two of the following additional metamagic modifiers, which can only be used while under the effect of the *Unleash* feature.

* **Amplified Spell (2):** Requires *Empowered Spell*. Your spell's numerical values are increased by **50%**.

* **Chained Spell (X + Y):** Requires *Twinned Spell*. Your one targeted spell is **twinned** **Y** times, with the range condition being determined with respect to the previous target. **X** is the level of the spell slot with which the spell is being cast, 1 for cantrips.

* **Heightened Spell (1 + X):** Your spell is treated as if it was cast at a spell slot X levels higher.

* **Instilled Spell (1 + X):** You add a random effect to your spell, that is determined by a d10 roll. You add +X to the result of this roll.

  | d10  | Additional effect                                            |
  | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | 1-2  | Nothing changes.                                             |
  | 3-4  | Your spell deals additional force damage equal to your **Charisma** modifier to all targets. |
  | 5-6  | Your spell is **heightened** by 1.                           |
  | 7    | Your spell is heightened by 2.                               |
  | 8    | If your spell has a single target, it's **twinned**. If your spell is area of effect, increase the area by 10 feet and roll again to get an additional effect. |
  | 9    | Your spell is **maximized**.                                 |
  | 10   | Your spell's damage **strikes critically**. If your spell doesn't deal damage, it's **maximized** instead. |

* **Maximized Spell (3):** Requires Empowered Spell. All numerical values of the spell represented by dice rolls assume their maximum possible values.

* **Reckless Spell (1):** Can't be combined with *Careful Spell*. When rolling damage for the spell, you roll an additional damage die. If the spell is a spell attack, you have disadvantage on the attack roll, and if the spell requires a saving throw, the DC is decreased by 2.

### Perfect Storm (20th level)

All restrictions stating you *cannot* commit certain acts during *Unleash* or *Suppress* are lifted.

During *Unleash*, you also shed light of your unique color (15/30 ft) and you have expertise in Charisma saving throws.

During *Suppress*, you have expertise in Wisdom saving throws.

## Sorcerous Origin: Dream Walker (1th level)

### Exceptional

You get to pick a color. All of your spells are tinted according to that choice. Your eyes are that color.

### Expanded Spell List

You also gain the option to learn the following spells, which count as part of your Sorcerer spell list:

| Circle | Spells           |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| 1st    | Sudden Awakening |
| 2nd    | Augury*          |
| 4th    | Divination*      |
| 5th    | Commune*         |
| 6th    | Find the Path*   |

<sup>*Whenever you cast one of these spells as a ritual, instead of the usual 10 minute casting time, you need to be asleep for at least an hour.</sup>

### Bonus proficiencies (1st level)

You gain expertise or proficiency in **Insight**, depending on whether you are already proficient or not.

### Vivid Dreams (1st level)

Every time you take a long rest, you might select between shaping your own dreams or having a chance of receiving meaningful, but very vague and unclear visions.

If during a long rest you have decided to shape a pleasant dream and your rest wasn't interrupted, you lose an additional exhaustion level and get **+1** to all **ability checks** until the next long rest.

Otherwise, the DM decides whether you got a vision or not and describes the vision to you. You then roll a **d20**. If you **roll under** your Sorcerer level, you gain lucidity and can attempt to interact with the visions.

### Sixth Sense (1st level)

You can spend **1 Sorcery Point** to cast **Guidance** on yourself.

### Déjà Vu (6th level)

You feel you have already seen something occuring in the past and are able to alter the chain of events that is going to follow.

Once a day, you can succeed on a saving throw, add +10 to your attack roll, or have an attack against you miss.

Moreover, as part of your *Vivid Dreams* feature, you can recall and revisit very specific dreams from the past, in an attempt to observe them more clearly. For every time you have had the same dream in the past, you can **subtract 1** from the **d20** on the lucidity check when revisiting that dream.

### Dream Walking (14th level)

You gain the ability to cast an improved version of *Dream* at will, without expanding spell slots. This can also be combined with your regular long rest sleep, provided that you aren't using *Vivid Dreams* to get a pleasant dream at the same time. 

If you cast that spell through this feature, you can switch freely between creatures once every 10 minutes and can also opt not to shape the target's dreams, but instead just observe and watch them unfold.

If you choose to make the target's dream a nightmare and they fail the saving throw, they also lose d3 Wisdom.

If you have already learned the *Dream* spell, you replace it with another 5th level spell for free.

### Clarity (20th level)

You become immune to mind affecting effects and can never be surprised. Even if you are asleep, you are aware of your body's surroundings and can wake up at any time. 

You get expertise or proficiency in Perception, depending on if you're already proficient or not, and you always see true within 30 feet of you.

You gain the ability to cast *Astral Projection* without expanding spell slots as part of your long rest sleep. You can't combine it, however, with your *Dream Walking* or *Vivid Dreams* features.
