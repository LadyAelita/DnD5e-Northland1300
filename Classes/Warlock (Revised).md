### Otherworldly Patron (1st level)

At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again and 6th, 10th and 18th level.

### Pact Magic (1st level)

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.

#### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

#### Spell Slots

The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Eldrtich Invocations (2nd level)

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

A level prerequisite in an invocation refers to warlock level, not character level.

### Pact Boon (3rd level)

At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift of your choice upon you for your loyal service. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again and 7th and 14th level.

### Pact Inquiry (5th level)

As an action, once per day, you entreat your patron for aid, regaining 1d4 of your expended spell slots.

From 9th level onwards, you can use this feature twice per day instead.

### Mystic Arcanum (11th level)

At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. You also gain access to one 6th-level arcanum spell slot.

You can expend your Mystic Arcanum spell slot to cast either one of your mystic arcana spells of the same or smaller level as that of the arcanum spell slot, or one of your pact magic spells, You regain all your expended mystic arcana spell slots on a long rest.

At each of the levels 13, 15 and 17, you gain a Mystic Arcanum spell and a corresponding spell slot of, respectively, 7th, 8th and 9th level.

### Transcendent Arcanum (20th level)

At 20th level, your study of otherworldly arcana has allowed you to uncover a secret long forgotten.

You gain access to one 10th-level arcanum spell slot, which works just as your other mystic arcana spell slots.

Choose one 9th-level spell from any class' spell list as your Transcendent Arcanum. You can only cast this spell through your transcendent arcanum spell slot.

You regain your transcendent arcanum spell slot on a long rest.

## Pact Boon: Pact of the Blade

### Pact Weapon (3rd level)

You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if you dismiss it (no action required, although you must be holding it to do so).

You can transform an existing weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.

You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

### Extra Attack (7th level)

You can attack twice instead of once on each turn, as long as you're holding your pact weapon.

### Hex Warrior (14th level)

You add your Charisma modifier to the damage you deal with your pact weapon.

## Pact Boon: Pact of the Tome

### Script of Shadows (3rd level)

Your patron gives you a book or a large scroll. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class' spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the script is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.

If you lose your script, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book.

### Inscribed Rituals (7th level)

You can choose three spells with the ritual tag from any class' spell list (the three needn't be from the same list) of 3rd or lower level. While your Script of Shadows is on your person, you can cast those spells as rituals without expending spell slots. They don't count against your number of spells known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.

### Warlock's Elaboration (14th level)

You add a spell of 6th or lower level from any class' spell list to your Script of Shadows. As long as it's on your person, you can cast this spell once a day without expending a spell slot.

## Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain

### Pact Servant (3rd Level)

You learn the *Find Familiar* spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, hellion, sprite or phase eyeling.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to use its reaction to make one attack of its own.

### Gift of Vitality (7th level)

Your familiar's maximum health is increased by your Warlock level.

### Gift of Resistance (14th level)

As long as your familiar is within 5 feet of you, you are resistant to everything your familiar is resistant or immune to, except for piercing, slashing or bludgeoning damage.

### Expanded Spell List

### Healing Light (1st Level)

You gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.

As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of one die). Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.

### Radiant Soul (6th level)

Your link to the Celestial allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire damage, you add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.

### Celestial Resistance (10th level)

You gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a short or long rest. These temporary hit points equal your warlock level + your Charisma modifier. Additionally, choose up to five creatures you can see at the end of the rest. Those creatures each gain temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.

### Searing Vengeance (18th level)

Once per day, the radiant energy you channel allows you to resist death. When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and is blinded until the end of your next turn.

## Otherworldly Patron: The Archfey

### Bonus Cantrips

You learn the *Druidcraft* and *Thorn Whip* cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don’t count against your number of cantrips known.

### Fey Presence (1st Level)

Once between rests, you have the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As a bonus action, cause each creature within 10 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. Creatures that fail the save are either charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.

### Misty Escape (6th level)

Once between rests, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.

### Beguiling Defenses (10th level)

Your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.

### TO-DO (18th level)

....

## Otherworldly Patron: The Fiend

### Bonus Cantrips

You learn the *Produce Flame* and *Thaumaturgy* cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don’t count against your number of cantrips known.

### Expanded Spell List

The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you, giving you the option to learn them.

| Circle  | Spells                                        |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **1st** | Bane, Burning Hands, Command                  |

### Dark One's Blessing (1st Level)

All your spells are of **demonic** source.

When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your Warlock level (minimum of 1).

### Dark One's Own Luck (6th level)

Twice between rests, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur.

### Fiendish Resilience (10th level)

You can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.

### See You In Hell (18th level)

You are able to execute a desperate, spiteful attack against a foe. Whenever you hit a creature with a charging strike or have the creature grappled, you can briefly open a portal, teleporting both yourself and that creature to either Hell or Abyss (your choice).

As both of you are hurled through the foul, abhorrent landscapes of that plane, you struggle in seemingly everlasting combat against each other. The fight lasts only 6 seconds on the Terrestrial Plane, but two hours in Hell. Therefore, this feature ends all effects affecting you or your target with a remaining duration smaller than two hours.

At the start of your next turn, you take 5d8 bludgeoning damage and 5d8 of either hellfire or demonic cold damage, for Hell and Abyss respectively. Your target instead takes 5d10 bludgeoning, 5d10 hellfire/demonic cold, and 5d10 psychic damage. If the target is a creature native to the plane of Hell, it doesn't take the psychic damage. Then, if any of you survives the damage, another portal opens in a location of your choice within 30 feet of the previous one, and those that have survived the infernal voyage drop out, falling prone in the nearest unoccupied space (you choose for both creatures if there are many such spaces). Those that have dropped to 0 hit points remain in Hell.

You can't use this feature again until you have finished a long rest.

## Otherworldly Patron: The Great Old One

### Bonus Cantrips

You learn the *Vicious Mockery* and *Thaumaturgy* cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don’t count against your number of cantrips known.

### Expanded Spell List

The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you, giving you the option to learn them.

| Circle  | Spells                                                |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **1st** | Dissonant Whispers, Hideous Laughter, Sanctuary       |
| **2nd** | Blindness/Deafness, Detect Thoughts, Phantasmal Force |
| **3rd** | Clairvoyance, Hypnotic Pattern, Sending               |
| **4th** | Black Tentacles, Confusion, Phantasmal Killer         |
| **5th** | Dominate Person, Geas, Telepathic Bond                |

### Awakened Mind (1st level)

Your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

### Eldritch Shapes (6th level)

You learn to alter your appearance in more than three spatial dimensions, making it more difficult to damage you. Once between rests, as a reaction to taking damage, you get supernatural resistance to all damage until the end of your next turn, and you cannot be hit critically.

### Beyond Comprehension (10th level)

You cannot be charmed and your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature deals the same amount of psychic damage to itself, without taking your resistance into account.

### Create Thrall (18th level)

You gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated or willing humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a Remove Curse spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again on a different creature.

You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. The charmed creature isn't forced to obey you directly, however it grows increasingly fascinated with you over time, slowly turning into a loyal servant. It never becomes mindlessly loyal, though.

## Otherworldly Patron: The Seeker

### Bonus Cantrips

You learn the *Dancing Lights* and *Magic Bolt* cantrips. They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don’t count against your number of cantrips known.

| **2nd** | Augury, Levitate, Locate Object                 |
| **3rd** | Clairvoyance, Malcolm's Minute Meteors, Sending |
| **4th** | Arcane Eye, Arcane Sanctum, Locate Creature     |
| **5th** | Animate Objects, Legend Lore, Passwall          |

### Shielding Aurora (1st level)

Once between rests, you can invoke the Seeker’s power to protect you from harm. As a bonus action, you create a whirling aurora of brilliant energy that swirls around you. Until the end of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage, and if a hostile creature ends its turn within 10 feet of you, it takes radiant damage equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier.

### Astral Refuge (6th level)

You gain the ability to step into an astral refuge. As an action, you disappear from the world for a brief moment and enter the Astral Plane, taking advantage of its timeless nature. While in your astral refuge, you can take two actions to cast spells that target only you. After using those two actions, you return to the space you occupied and your turn ends.

### Far Wanderer (10th level)

You no longer need to breathe, and you gain resistance to fire damage and cold damage.

### Astral Sequestration (18th level)

You gain the ability to sequester yourself and your allies on the Astral Plane.

By performing a special ritual over the course of 1 minute, you shift yourself and up to ten willing creatures you can see to the Astral Plane. You and those creatures gain the benefits of a short rest while sequestered on the Astral Plane. You then return to the spaces you all occupied when you used this ability, with no time having passed in the world.

During this short rest, you and the creatures you sequester can make use of any options available during a rest that affect only you and the creatures you sequester.

Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

## Otherworldly Patron: The Undying

### Bonus Cantrips

| Circle  | Spells                                           |

### One of Us (1st level)

Undead have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of Fireball). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.

### Spiritual Conduit (6th level)

Once per day, you can give yourself vitality when you cheat death or when you help someone else cheat it. You can regain hit points equal to 1d8 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point) when you succeed on a death saving throw or when you stabilize a creature with Spare the Dying.

### Undying Nature (10th level)

You can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests.

In addition, you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.

Moreover, you are resistant to necrotic damage.

### They Always Come Back (18th level)

You know how to channel the power of undeath to relentlessly preserve your own existence. At the start of your turn, if you have 0 hit points, you can regain a hit point and immediately rise up, even if your body has been mutilated, as long as it still has enough parts to let you perform any type of action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier per day.

## Otherworldly Patron: The Void

Once between rests, you can completely ignore an attack or an incoming effect. You can make the decision after the attack or effect hits, but before any damage or other numerical values describing the magnitude of the effect are rolled.

### Vacant Resilience (10th level)

You can hold your breath indefinitely, and you don't require food, water, or sleep, although you still require rest to reduce exhaustion and still benefit from finishing short and long rests.

Moreover, you are resistant to cold and shadow damage.

### Veil of Antienergy (18th level)

Once per day, you can expend all your current pact magic spell slots to create a veil around yourself, through which no magical energy can pass. As long as the veil surrounds you, you are immune to magic and resistant to all damage, but cannot cast spells.

The veil disappears after absorbing a number of spell levels equal or greater than 5 times the number of spell slots expended.
