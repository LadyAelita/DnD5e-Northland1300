### Description

Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from magical, demonic or supernatural creatures of either good or evil alignment (the choice is made at the moment of casting the spell). For the duration, said creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. You can end the spell early by using either of the following:

**Break Enchantment.** As an action, you touch a creature that is charmed, frightened, possessed or sapped by one of such creatures, ending both the spell and all of these conditions. 

**Dismissal.** As an action, make a melee attack against one of such creatures you can reach. On a hit, you attempt to banish the creature back to its home plane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.
