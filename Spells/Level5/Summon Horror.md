### Description

You summon a Hellish Horror that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The demon's attitude depends on the value of the gem used as a material component for this spell. Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. At the start of the demon's turn, you make a Charisma check, with a bonus equal to the gem's value divided by 20. The check DC starts at 10 and increases by 2 each round. You can issue orders to the demon and have it obey you as long as you succeed on the Charisma check. If you have used a doomstone rather than a garnet, you have advantage on these checks.

If the check fails, the Horror is no longer under your control. On its next turn, it takes no action, except for using its *Horrid Bellow* ability. It then attacks the nearest creatures for 1d6 rounds before disappearing.

As part of casting the spell, you can scribe a circle on the ground using the blood of an intelligent humanoid slain within the past 24 hours. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. The summoned demon cannot cross the circle or target anyone in it while the spell lasts.
