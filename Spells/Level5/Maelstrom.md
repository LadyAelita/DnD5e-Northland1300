### Description

A mass of 5-foot-deep water appears and swirls in a 30-foot radius centered on a point you can see within range. The point must be on ground or in a body of water. Until the spell ends, that area is difficult terrain, and any creature that starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 6d6 bludgeoning damage and be pulled 10 feet toward the center. A successful save halves the damage.

If the spell is cast onto a reservoire of water large enough to contain the entire area affected by the spell, the damage is increased to 6d12.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the radius increases by 5 feet and the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
