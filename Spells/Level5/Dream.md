### Description

This spell allows you to invade a creature's dream. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance, sleep-like state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is by default not aware of their surroundings and can't take actions or move. They have to make Perception checks to become aware of anything occurring next to them, and they have disadvantage on all those checks.

If the target is asleep, the messenger traverses the Ethereal Plane and appears in the target's dream. They can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance as an action taken in the dream, ending the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.

You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target's sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.

If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target's body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.
