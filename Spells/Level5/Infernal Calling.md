### Description

Uttering a dark incantation, you summon a demon from the Infernal Plane. You choose the demon's type, which must be one of challenge rating 6 or lower. The demon appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The demon actually dies when it drops to 0 hit points, rather than just disappear. The demon also gains a one-time ability to return to Hell, ending the spell.

The demon is unfriendly toward you and your companions. Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. It is under the Dungeon Master's control and acts according to its nature and individual personality on each of its turns, which might result in its attacking you if it thinks it can prevail, or trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for limited service. The DM has the creature's statistics.

On each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you). It obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with its desires, especially if the result would draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must try to convince it to cooperate. If you're using a doomstone as a component, you get advantage on all checks against the demon, and it gets disadvantage on checks against you.

If you have a written pact with an individual demon, you can summon it if it is of the appropriate challenge rating plus 1, and it obeys your commands to the extent and for the time specified in the contract, and then it departs.

If you have called a demon with this spell and it hasn't departed yet, the gemstone used as a component keeps glowing until the demon leaves. Until that time, you cannot use this spell to call another demon. You can, however, cast it on the last called demon, demanding that it departs. The demon then makes a Charisma saving throw (with a disadvantage if you're using a doomstone). If it fails, it gets banished, ending the spell. Otherwise, nothing happens.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.
