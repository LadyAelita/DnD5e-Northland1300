### Description

This spell shuts down all electronic devices within range that are not wielded by or under the direct control of a creature. If an electronic device within range is used by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw to prevent the device from being shut down. While the spell remains active, no electronic device within range can be started or restarted.

Creatures that themselves **are** electronic have to succeed in the Constitution saving throw, or else they become stunned for the duration.

**Partial Save:** The devices are only shut down instantly and nothing prevents them from being turned right back on. The electronic creatures affected by this spell get stunned for 1 round.

**Failed Save:** The electronic creatures affected by the spell get dazed for 1 round.

**At Higher Levels:** Either the range is increased to 240 ft (6th level), 1000 ft (7th level), 0.5 mile (8th level) and 1 mile (9th level), or the duration in increased to 10 minutes (6th level), 1 hour (7th level), 8 hours (8th level), 24 hours (9th level). Moreover, casting this spell at 8th level imposes disadvantage on the saving throw for those holding the devices, and at 9th level, there is no opportunity for said saving throw. The electronic creatures can still save as per usual.
