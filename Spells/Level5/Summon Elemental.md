### Description

The type of gem dust used as a material component depends on the type of the elemental. Alternatively, opal dust can be used regardless of the element.

The casting time of the spell influences the duration. You can either cast it within 1 action and have it last a minute, or cast it for 1 minute and have it last 8 hours.

You call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, water, bright light or absolute darkness that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points.

The DM has the elemental's statistics.

The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any **verbal** commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). Telepathy can also work, but this spell on its own doesn't provide such a communication channel. If you don't issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

You can break the spell manually. However, when the spell ends (by any means), the elemental doesn't automatically disappear. Instead, you lose your absolute control of the elemental. The elemental might become hostile toward you and your companions and it might attack, depending on the difference in alignment between you and the elemental. For instance, a fire elemental is chaotic neutral, so it would try to attack a lawful neutral summoner. An earth elemental would just become neutral, meaning they just defend themselves as long as it's necessary, and then either depart or pursue their own agenda. An uncontrolled elemental will automatically be dismissed after an hour.

A hostile elemental can still be persuaded by you to cooperate, or at the very least, leave and cease attacking. The DC of the checks will vary depending on the type of rhetoric (whether it's Intimidation, Persuasion, Deception etc.), the elemental's personal bonuses and on how different your alignment is from the elemental's. Certain rhetoric types will work better against some elementals than the others.

Re-casting this spell in order to summon another elemental causes the previous elemental summoned with it to be dismissed, if it hasn't already happened.

This spell can be also cast to either refresh the remaining duration on a controlled elemental, or regain control over an uncontrolled elemental that you have summoned with this spell previously. Attempts to re-acquire control will be noticed by the uncontrolled elemental and once it's set free again, there might be an even bigger chance it becomes hostile (depending on the personality).

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.
