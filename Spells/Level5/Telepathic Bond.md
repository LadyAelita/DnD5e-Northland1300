### Description

You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren't affected by this spell.

Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication is possible over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes of existence.

**At Higher Levels:** The duration increases to 8 hours (6th level), 24 hours (7th level), 7 days (8th level), 28 days (9th level).
