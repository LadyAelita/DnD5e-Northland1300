### Description

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 5d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on constructs.

Undead targeted with this spell take true damage instead of being healed (the number stays the same). A successful Constitution save halves the damage.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing (or damage) increases by (1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier) for each slot level above 5th.
