### Description

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creatureâ€™s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side). 

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage, can't be dispelled by *Dispel Magic* and reflects all rays or bolt attacks. However, *Disintegrate* destroys the wall instantly. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.

**At Higher Levels:** The area of the wall is increased: 20 feet radius or 40 panels (10 ft x 10 ft) (6th level), 50 feet radius or 250 panels (7th level), 100 feet radius or 1000 panels (8th level), 500 ft radius or 25000 panels (9th level).
