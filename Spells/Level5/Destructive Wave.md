### Description

You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 sonic damage, as well as 5d6 radiant or necrotic damage (you choose at character creation whether your character always deals radiant or always deals necrotic damage with these types of spells), and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
