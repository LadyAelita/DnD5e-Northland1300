### Description

You transmute your quiver so it "produces" an endless supply of nonmagical ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand when you reach for it.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver. Each time you make such a ranged attack, the piece of ammunition magically returns back to your quiver, having made contact with the target or having clearly missed. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.
