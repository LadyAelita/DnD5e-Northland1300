### Description

You touch a single computerized device or computer system to conjure a program that is executed on the target device and runs in a loop, awaiting remote commands from you. It's a partially sentient piece of software imprinted with vestiges of your own skills and computer abilities. For the duration of the spell, you can use a bonus action to have the program execute a computer-related task that would normally require an action on your behalf. The program makes Intelligence ability checks using your ability score and proficiency bonuses (including your proficiencies, if applicable).

You have a limited telepathic bond with the program, out to a range of 500 feet from the device or system where it has been installed. If you move beyond this range, the program crashes in 2d4 rounds, as if the duration of the spell had expired. Moving within range again immediately reestablishes the bond. You can channel this bond through another computer-like device, allowing the program to also provide you with the exact output of the actions it was performing on your behalf.

The program is bound to the system in which it was created, and it stays there until it is dismissed or the spell's duration expires. 

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell's duration increases to 1 hour. Additionally, your telepathic bond is effective out to a range of 1,000 feet, and if you leave the range of the bond, the program continues performing its last directed task until the spell expires.
