### Description

Flame-like shadows wreathe the area surrounding your body, spreading from you in a 10-foot radius, making you heavily obscured. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. However, the caster can see through it at all times.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell cast at the same or lower level, the spell that created the light is dispelled. If that spell was cast at higher level, the two spells cancel out inside the intersection.

Until the spell ends, you have resistance to radiant damage. In addition, whenever a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, the shadows lash out at that creature, dealing it 3d8 necrotic damage. Undead creatures take 3d8 psychic damage instead.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
