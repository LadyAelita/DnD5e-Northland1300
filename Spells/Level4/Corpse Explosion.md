### Description

You point at a medium sized or larger corpse or a corporeal undead creature under your control, that you can see within range. The target violently erupts in a gruesome explosion. All non-undead creatures within 15 feet of the target make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 necrotic damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
