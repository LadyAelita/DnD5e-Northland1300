### Description

You attempt to send one extraplanar creature that you can see within range back to their home plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't return.

On a successful save, the target is stunned until the end of its next round.

**Partial Save:** The target is banished momentarily and returns at the end of their next turn.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th.
