### Description

This spell allows you to bypass security in order to create an account on a foreign system. The account you create grants you administrator privileges in any network or system not enhanced through technomagic. It defeats any technomagic spells of 3rd level or lower.

Once the duration of the spell expires, the account is wiped from the system. System logs still show the activity of the user, but any details regarding that deleted account cannot be found or traced.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you are able to bypass technomagic spells if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.
