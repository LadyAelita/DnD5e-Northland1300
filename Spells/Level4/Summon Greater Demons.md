### Description

You utter foul words, summoning one demon from Hell. You choose the demon's type, which must be one of challenge rating 5 or lower. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and ir disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any creature within reach that has attacked it.

At the end of each of the demon's turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw. The demon has disadvantage on this saving throw if you have used a doomstone as a a material component. On a failed save, the demon continues to obey you. On a successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of its ability. If you stop concentrating on the spell before it reaches its full duration, the demon makes a Charisma saving throw. On a success, it doesn't disappear for 1d6 rounds if it still has hit points. On a failure, it disappears immediately.

As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with either your blood, the garnet dust used as a material component, or blood of an intelligent humanoid killed within the last 24 hours. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can't cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone within it. Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 4th.
