### Description

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d10 psychic damage and becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the target takes half the damage instead, and the spell ends.

**Partial Save:** The target takes the full initial damage and is then frightened only until the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th. If you cast it using a spell slot of 6th or 7th level, the imposed condition is "panicked". If you cast it using a spell slot of 8th or 9th level, the imposed condition is "terrified".
