### Description

You conjure a phantom guardian in an unoccupied space that you can see within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it. In the process, you use the emerald dust to create a circle with a radius up to 30 feet, centered on the target point. The circle can be intersected by walls not more than 5 feet thick. The guardian can assume various forms, the default being a humanoid-like elemental, wielding a sword.

The guardian is invisible to all creatures except you and can't be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within the emerald circle without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the circle starts to glow, and the elemental gives an ominous warning, commanding the intruder to leave. The guardian sees invisible creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.

The guardian will cast a sending spell to you whenever somebody tries to pass by it, succeeds in doing so, or is killed by it, unless they provide the password.

At the start of each of your turns, the guardian attempts to attack one creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. Their attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 slashing damage.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration increases to 24 hours on 5th level, 3 days on 6th level, 10 days on 7th level, 30 days on 8th level and 6 months on 9th level.
