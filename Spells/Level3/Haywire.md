### Description

This spell plays havoc with electronic devices, making the use of such devices all but impossible. Each electronic device in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range is subject to random behavior while it remains within the area. A device not held by a creature is automatically affected. If an electronic device is held by a creature, that creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or have the device affected by the spell.

At the start of each of your turns, roll a d6 for each affected device to determine its behavior. Except where otherwise indicated, that behavior lasts until the start of your next turn while this spell is in effect.

1: The device shuts down and must be restarted. Do not roll again for this device until it is restarted.

2â€“4: The device does not function.

5: The device experiences a power surge, causing an electric shock to the wielder (if any) and one random creature within 5 feet of the device. Each affected creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 6d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

6: The device is usable as normal.

Simple, non-intelligent electronic constructs in that area suffer from the same effect. Intelligent constructs are instead slowed for the duration.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radius of the sphere affected by the spell increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
