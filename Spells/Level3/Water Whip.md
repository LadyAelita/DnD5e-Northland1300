### Description

You momentarily conjure a whip made of water. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within range, dealing 4d12 slashing damage on a hit. Fire elementals take additional 2d6 cold damage.

Optionally, you can forfeit two dice of slashing damage dealt and have the target make a Strength saving throw, or else they are knocked prone or pulled up to 25 feet toward you (your choice).

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot above 3rd.
