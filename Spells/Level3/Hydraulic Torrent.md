### Description

You call forth a powerful stream of water that shoots out of your hand at very high pressure, battering all creatures and obstacles in its path until it strikes something it cannot push past.

All creatures in a 120 feet long, 5 feet wide line, have to make a Strength saving throw, taking 6d6 bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone (if they are standing) and knocked back 15 feet on a failure, or taking half the damage and and stopping the stream on a success. Creatures of size smaller than Medium have disadvantage on the save. Large creatures have advantage, and Huge or Gargantuan creatures automatically succeed.

Fire Elementals take additional 2d6 cold damage.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd, and the knockback distance increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
