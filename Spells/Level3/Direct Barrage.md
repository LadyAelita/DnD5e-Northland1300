### Description

You throw any number of weapons or fire any number of pieces of ammunition into the air to direct each of them onto enemies in front of you. 

A number of creatures of your choice in a 60-foot cone, equal to the number of thrown weapons or pieces of ammunition you have expended, must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4dY damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, where dY is the base damage die of the expended thrown weapon or ammunition. The damage type is also the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.
