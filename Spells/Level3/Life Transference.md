### Description

You sacrifice some of your health to mend another creature's (or your own) injuries. You take 4d8 necrotic damage, and one creature of your choice that you can see within range regains a number of hit points equal to twice the necrotic damage you take. This spell has no effect on constructs.

You can target an undead creature with this spell, in which case it makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it receives twice the necrotic damage you took as true damage. On a success, it takes half (in other words, it takes the same amount of damage as you have, rather than twice that).

If, after receiving the damage, you have half or more of your maximum hit points remaining, the heal's strength is triple that damage, rather than double. You cannot benefit from this while targeting yourself or an undead creature with this spell.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the necrotic damage dealt to you increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
