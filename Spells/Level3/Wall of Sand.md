### Description

You conjure up a wall of swirling sand on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 10 feet thick, and it vanishes when the spell ends. It blocks line of sight but not movement. A creature is blinded and slowed while in the wall's space, except as part of the slowed condition, it must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves there, instead of 2. A creature that starts its turn in the wall's space takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
