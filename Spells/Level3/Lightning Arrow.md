### Description

The next time you make a ranged weapon attack until the start of your next turn, the weapon's ammunition, or the weapon itself if it's a thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning.

Choose a point within range. All creatures within 15 feet of that point make a Dexterity saving throw, being dazed until the end of their next turn and taking 4d8 lightning damage on a failure, or taking half as much damage on a miss.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
