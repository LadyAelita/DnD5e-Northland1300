### Description

You touch a quiver containing arrows or bolts, affecting up to 20 pieces of ammunition. When a target is hit by a ranged weapon attack using a piece of affected ammunition, the target takes an extra 2d6 cold damage. The spell's magic ends on the piece of ammunition when it hits or misses.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d6 for every 2 spell slot levels above the 3rd.
