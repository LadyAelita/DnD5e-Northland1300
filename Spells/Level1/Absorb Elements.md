### Description

The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and optionally storing it for the next attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. You can also optionally concentrate for up to 2 rounds. The first attack you make while concentrating on this spell will end the concentration, and if it hits, will deal extra 2d6 damage of the triggering type.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st. Moreover, the damage you take from the triggering effect is decreased by 5 for each slot level above 1st. This mitigation is applied after resistance.
