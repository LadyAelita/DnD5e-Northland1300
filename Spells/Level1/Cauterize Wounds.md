### Description

The target that has less than half of its maximum hit points regains a number of hit points equal to 1d10 + your spellcasting modifier. This spell has no effect on constructs, but can also heal undead.

Afterwards, the target takes 1d4 - 1 true damage at the end of their every turn for the duration. If the duration ends up being negative, it's assumed to be 0, meaning this negative effect doesn't take place at all.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d10 + your spellcasting modifier for each slot level above 1st, and the backlash damage increases by 1d4 - 1 for each slot level above 1st.
