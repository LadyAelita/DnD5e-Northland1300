### Description

The target creature in range other than yourself receives a temporary 2nd level spell slot which is available to them for the duration. This spell slot might only be used for arcane spellcasting, not divine magic.

If the received spell slot would be of higher circle than the highest circle available to the target creature, the creature receives a spell slot of that highest available circle instead.

**At Higher Levels:** The level of the spell slot received by the target is increased by 1 for every slot level (of the spent spell slot) above the 1st. The maximal resulting spell slot level is 9th.
