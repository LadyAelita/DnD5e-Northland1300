### Description

For the duration, you know if there are magical, demonic or supernatural creatures of either good or evil alignment (the choice is made at the moment of casting the spell) within 30 feet of you, as well as where the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place of object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or desecrated.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by a thin sheet of lead.
