### Description

You perform a special religious ceremony that is infused with magic. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following rites, the target of which must be within 10 feet of you throughout the casting.

Atonement: You touch one willing creature whose alignment has changed, and you make a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a successful check, you restore the target to its original alignment.

Bless Water: You touch one vial of water and cause it to become holy water. The holy water created this way can be used by one of your deity's followers to attempt and bless something or someone in a minute long ritual. A cleric will automatically succeed, providing the target with the effect of the Bless spell for a day. A non-cleric will have a (50% + 5 * Wisdom modifier) % chance, without knowing the result until the bonus would come into play. In case an item is targeted, it might receive a random small permanent enchantment. The effects of this don't stack on the same target.

Coming of Age: You touch one humanoid on the day of their coming of age. The required age is determined by your religion or local tradition. All of the target's abilities are increased by 1 permanently. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.

Curse Water: You can conjure unholy water in a manner similar to Bless Water. Instead of applying Bless, it will apply Bane, and instead of creating helpful enchanted items, it will create cursed ones.

Dedication: You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your god's service. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes a saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the save. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.

Funeral Rite: You touch one corpse, and for the next 7 days, the target can't become undead by any means short of a wish spell.

Wedding: You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded together in marriage. For the rest of their lives or until the marriage is revoked, each target gains a +1 bonus to AC while they are within 30 feet of each other. A creature can benefit from this rite again only of widowed.
