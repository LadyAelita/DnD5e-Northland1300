### Description

A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier. This spell has no effect on constructs.

Alternatively, you can make a ranged spell touch attack against an undead creature. On a hit, it takes the amount of damage it would have been healed for as true damage instead.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 + your spellcasting modifier for each slot level above 1st.
