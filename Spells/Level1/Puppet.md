### Description

Your gesture forces one humanoid you can see within range to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target must move up to its speed in a direction you choose. In addition, you can cause the target to drop whatever it is holding. This spell has no effect on a humanoid that is immune to being charmed.

**Partial Save:** The target's speed is halved for one round instead.
