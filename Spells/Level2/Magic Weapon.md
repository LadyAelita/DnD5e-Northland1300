### Description

You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.

If you optionally use a material component - a lapis lazuli gemstone worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes, the spell is permanent.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2, and the lapis' cost to 200 gp. When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3 and the lapis' cost to 500 gp.
