### Description

This spell works to actively hide your presence within a network. For the spell's duration, an user of your choice connected or about to connect to a network gains a +10 bonus to Intelligence checks and saving throws to avoid detection by administrators, bots, tracking software, and the like. When the target disconnects from the network, having been under the protection of this spell for their entire login session, no trace of their presence in that network is kept.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the duration is increased to 3 minutes (at 3rd level), 15 minutes (4th level), 1 hour (5th level), 2 hours (6th level), 4 hours (7th level), 10 hours (8th level) or 24 hours (9th level).
