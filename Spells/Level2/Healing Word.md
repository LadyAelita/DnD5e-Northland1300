### Description

A creature of your choice that has just taken damage and that you can see within range regains hit points equal to 3d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on constructs.

Alternatively, you can target an undead creature that has just dealt damage and that you can see within range. In this case, it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking the amount by which it would have been healed as true damage on a failure, or half of that on a success.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 + your spellcasting modifier for each slot level above 2nd.
