### Description

You launch a compact repair drone, which mechanically changes its shape pulling out of the portable container. The diminutive winged metal drone flies to a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range.

Until the spell ends, once during your turn, you can cause the drone to restore 1d6 hit points to a construct that occupies the same space as the drone. The drone can't heal non-construct creatures.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the drone up to 30 feet to a space you can see. If, as a result of this movement, it passes through multiple creatures, you decide which target (if any) gets healed.

When the spell ends, the drone's battery runs out and it falls to the ground. If it wasn't severely damaged as a result of the fall (for example, through falling into water), it can be recovered and fixed with the *Mending* cantrip.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the repaired damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
