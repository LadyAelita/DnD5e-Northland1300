### Description

You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff (your DM might allow other creatures to be summoned as steeds). The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, fiend or an undead (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand celestial, venefical, infernal or black speech (respectively, depending on its chosen type).

Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your steed. While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.

When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it makes death saves as if it was a player character. If it dies, it dies permanently and cannot be resurrected.

You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing it to disappear. In this case, casting this spell again summons the same steed. Provided that at least 24 hours have passed since, its restored to its hit point maximum.
