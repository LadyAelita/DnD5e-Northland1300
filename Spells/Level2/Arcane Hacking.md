### Description

You gain advantage on all Intelligence checks using hacking tools to break software encryption or online security when using a foreign system. This spell also allows you to break 2nd-level and lower protective spells such as Arcane Lock or Glyph of Warding by making an Intelligence check using hacking tools against the spell save DC of the spell's caster.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can attempt to counteract a spell set to secure the foreign system if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.
