### Description

You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration, and at the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. If it succeeds, its only dazed until the end of its next turn.

**Partial Save:** The creature is blinded or deafened only until the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
