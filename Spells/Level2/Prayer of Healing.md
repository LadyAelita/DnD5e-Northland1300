### Description

You raise a prayer to the heavens above, asking for mercy on behalf of your most wounded allies. The *weakest* target within 60 feet of you regains 1d6 hit points. This effect can be used again on subsequent turns as a bonus action, as long as the spell lasts.

The *weakest* target for the purpose of this spell is the ally with the lowest number of hit points (including temporary hit points), where unconscious, battered and dying targets are prioritized, judging by the severity of the condition. If two potential targets have the same number of hit points and the same condition, you decide which one to heal. 

Secondary companions (such as animals or familiars), mounts and summoned creatures are not healed, unless there are no other damaged allies within range.

Shapeshifted allies are healed as per usual, provided that they have shapeshifted voluntarily.

Allied constructs (on whom this magic would have no effect) and undead (whom it would harm), as well as characters that are forced to be allies of the caster against their will by means of compulsion magic are never healed.

If since your previous turn, your ally has acted as an enemy of yours against their will, by attacking or causing a harmful effect on you or your other allies, or by causing beneficial effects on your enemies, you can choose to exclude the offending ally from the list of potential healing targets on this turn.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
