### Description

You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can't be charmed succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the targets are charmed by you and have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until they can no longer hear you. On a successful save, the target is dazed until the end of their next turn.

The entire spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer speak. It ends for an individual target if said target is attacked or takes damage, in which event the remaining targets can make a Wisdom saving throw that, on a success, ends the spell for the creature making the save as well.
