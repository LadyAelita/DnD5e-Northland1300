### Description

You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spell's duration. On a successful save, it takes half the damage and is only dazed for one round.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range, as long as it's within 30 feet of the current target. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d6 and the crushing damage increases by 1d6, for each 2 spell slot levels above the 2nd.
