### Description

You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, once during your turn, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit points to a creature that occupies the same space as the spirit. The spirit can't heal constructs.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see. If, as a result of this movement, it passes through multiple creatures, you decide which target (if any) gets healed.

The spirit can also target undead. It then attempts a melee touch spell attack using your spell attack bonus. On hit, instead of being healed, an undead target will receive the same amount as true damage.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
