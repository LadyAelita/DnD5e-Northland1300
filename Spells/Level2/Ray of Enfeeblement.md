### Description

A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell touch attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 necrotic damage and loses d6 Strength for the duration.

The Strength score sap caused by subsequent instances of this spell on the same target don't stack, rather only the highest sap is applied, with the duration of the most recent instance.

This spell has no effect on constructs, and has the opposite effect on undead, healing them for the necrotic damage dealt, and increasing their Strength score by d6.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every spell slot level above the 2nd. Moreover, the Strength sap increases to d8 at 4th level, d10 at 6th level, d12 at 8th level and 2d8 at 9th level.
