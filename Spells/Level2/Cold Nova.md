### Description

A flurry of magic snowballs erupts from a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 cold damage and is slowed until the end if its next turn on a failed save, or takes half as much damage and isn't slowed on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
