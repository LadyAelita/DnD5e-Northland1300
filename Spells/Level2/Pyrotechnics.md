### Description

Choose an area of flame that you can see and that can fit within a 5-foot cube within range. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.

**Fireworks:** The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must make on a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d8 fire damage and being blinded until the end of your next turn on a failure, or taking half the damage and not being blinded on a success.

**Smoke:** Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured and the creatures in that area are dazed. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.
