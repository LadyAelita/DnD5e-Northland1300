### Description

Choose one creature you can see within range, that's at least 30 feet above the ground. Yellow strips of magical energy loop around the creature. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it descends down with a velocity of 50 feet per second (300 feet per round). On a successful save, it's only restrained until the end of its next turn.

The creature keeps falling down until the spell ends or until it hits the ground, whichever occurs earlier. On impact, it takes 4d6 fall damage. From that moment until the spell ends, the creature's movement speed is halved, while its flying speed is reduced to 0 and cannot be increased in any way.

The spell ends when you can no longer see the creature. If the creature falls out of your line of sight within the first 6 seconds of its fall, you don't even begin to concentrate.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each spell slot level above the 2nd, with the exception of the total being 17d6 at 8th level, and 20d6 at 9th level.
