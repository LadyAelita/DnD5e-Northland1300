### Description

You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice that you can see within range. The bolt then leaps up to three times, where subsequent targets must be within 30 feet of the previous one. A target can be a creature or an object. Each individual target can be targeted by a single instance of this spell only once.

Each target of this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

All creatures positioned directly on a 5-foot wide line between any pair of subsequent targets of this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 damage on a failure or no damage on a success.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the bolt can leap one additional time for every slot level above 6th, and the damage dealt increases by 1d8 for every slot level above 6th.
