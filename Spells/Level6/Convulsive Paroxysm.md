### Description

Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target starts to suffer from seizures. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this spell.

The target must use all its movement shaking aggressively without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, the creature can make a Charisma saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save, the spell ends.
