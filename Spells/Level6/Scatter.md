### Description

The air quivers around up to five creatures of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to resist this spell. If it does so, it's instead restrained until the end of their next turn. You teleport each affected target to an unoccupied space that you can see within 120 feet of you. That space must be on a solid horizontal surface.
