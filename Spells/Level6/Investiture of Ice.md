### Description

Until the spell ends, ice rimes your body, and you gain the following benefits.

• You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.

• You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement.

• The ground in a 15-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you.

• Every time you cast a Water spell you create d4 shards of ice floating around you. You can have up to a number of ice shards equal to half your caster level + your spellcasting modifier. All the shards and items conjured from them melt into water when the spell ends. You can also create d4 shards of ice as a bonus action, and 4 shards of ice as an action.

• As a reaction, you can merge a number of shards up to your spellcasting modifier to create a shield that lasts until the start of your next turn, granting you +1 to your AC and Dexterity saving throws for every expended shard.

• As a bonus action, you can conjure an icy sword as a result of combining a number of shards up to your spellcasting modifier. It counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. You can make a number of attacks equal to the number of shards expended, before the sword breaks. The sword has a reach of 5 feet and deals 1d8 slashing damage and 4d6 cold damage on hit.

• As an action, you send multiple barrages of ice shards either at a single or at multiple targets within 60 feet of you, limited only by the number of shards available to you. Each barrage consists of 3 shards which strike simultaneously. Make a ranged spell attack for each individual barrage, dealing 2d4 piercing damage and 2d8 cold damage on hit.
