### Description

You unleash a vile, crippling burst of negative energy on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.

If the target is an undead creature, it regains 90 hit points instead.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for every slot level above 6th, and the undead heal increases by 20 for every slot level above 6th.
