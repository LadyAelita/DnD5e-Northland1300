### Description

Flames race across your body, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet for the spell's duration. The flames don't harm you. Until the spell ends, you gain the following benefits.

• You are immune to fire damage and have resistance to cold damage.

• Any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 5d10 fire damage.

• Once per turn, when you deal fire damage, you can roll one of the damage dice an additional time and add the result to the total.

• As an action, you can throw a burst of fire at your enemies. All creatures in a 30-foot cone have to make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d6 damage on a failure or half as much on a success.
