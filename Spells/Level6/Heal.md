### Description

Choose a creature that you can see within range. A surge of positive energy washes through the creature, causing it to regain 90 hit points. The spell also ends blindness, deafness, and any diseases affecting the target. This spell has no effect on constructs.

If an undead creature is targeted, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 14d6 true damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of healing increases by 20 for each slot level above 6th, and the amount of damage dealt to undead increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 6th.
