### Description

While speaking an intricate incantation, you cut yourself with a diamond dagger, taking 2d4 true damage. You then drip your blood on the spell's other components and touch them, transforming them into a construct that serves as your familiar.

The DM has the creature's statistics. It is your faithful companion, and it dies if you die. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice if the construct is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by that total, and the construct's hit point maximum and current hit points are both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit point, and that change to your and the construct's hit points ends when you finish your next long rest. The hit point maximum reduction can't be removed by any means before then, except by the construct's death.

You can have only one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, the spell fails.
