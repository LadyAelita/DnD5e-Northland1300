# 3rd level

+ **Beacon of Hope:** also gives advantage on Charisma saves
+ **Bestow Curse:** no more concentration; additional curse variant:
   - the target loses 2d4 Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma (your choice).
+ **Blinding Smite:** merged with attack, optional concentration. Clarification: you decide whether to concentrate or not *before* knowing the result of the save.
+ **Clairvoyance:** minor: you concentrate on the cosmic opal that serves as the material component - you use it as a "screen" or a "speaker" of sorts
+ **Conjure Animals:** renamed to "Summon Animals"
+ **Conjure Barrage:** renamed to "Direct Barrage"; now requires you to physically use/throw/shoot X pieces of ammunition or throwing weapon (therefore you need said weapon equipped). The ammunition or weapon doesn't have to be non-magical anymore. As a result, you can pick X targets within the 60ft cone. Each of them will receive 4dY damage of the same type as the weapon's damage, where Y is the weapon's damage die. For example - shooting 3 normal arrows from a longbow will deal 4d8 damage to 3 targets in the spell's area. Basically this spell allows your character to execute an attack that's normally difficult to pull off, let alone within 3-6 seconds, by using magic to direct the projectiles.
+ **Counterspell:** finalized: Autosuccess vs spells of level equal or lower to counterspell's SL. Against spells of SL higher than the counter SL, let X = the difference between the spell SL and the counter SL, and Y = the target spell's caster's spellcasting modifier. Then you need to succeed on a spellcasting ability check against the DC of 8 + X + Y.
+ **Dispel Magic:** see Updated-Rules.pdf, except the DC is 8 + X + Y + 1 for every creature or object holding an effect that's not in the center of the area (X and Y just like with Counterspell)
+ **Elemental Weapon:** now Wizards (and Sorcerers) can have it as well; no more concentration; can be used to enchant a weapon permanently, in which case it consumes a 150gp gem representing the element related to the selected damage type
+ **Endurion's Cold Arrows:** Just like Flame Arrows, except they deal cold damage.
+ **Enemies Abound:** no more concentration
+ **Fear:** no more concentration
+ **Flame Arrows:** no more concentration, now enchants the entire quiver, which is 20 arrows or bolts; added scaling: +1d6/2 SL above 3rd.
+ **Gaseous Form:** the target becomes immune to nonmagical slashing, piercing and bludgeoning damage, and resistant to magical -//- damage, but vulnerable to fire and force damage; added scaling: +5 ft flying speed/2 SL above 3rd; +1h of duration/SL above 3rd.
+ **Glyph of Warding:** material component depending on the element of the stored spell or desired damage type:

| Damage    | Gem type    |
| --------- | ----------- |
| fire      | Obsidian    |
| cold      | Prasiolite  |
| acid      | Aventurine  |
| radiant   | Diaspore    |
| lightning | Chrysoprase |
| sonic     | Chrysoprase |
| shadow    | Aventurine  |
| ethereal  | Emerald     |

+ **Haste:** added scaling: target +1 crea / SL above 3rd
+ **Haywire:** is an Intelligence save now
+ **Hunger of Hadar:** renamed to "Legion's Hunger"; you essentially cast Darkness at 3rd level, except it has different params (range 150 ft, duration conc. up to 1min, area of 20 ft radius sphere) and deals 2d6 shadow damage to creatures inside
+ **Invisibility to Cameras:** renamed to "Invisibility to Seeing Devices". Can now target up to 5 creatures.
+ **Leomund's Tiny Hut:** renamed to "Cain's Refuge"
+ **Life Transference:** can now be used to hurt undead, although they get a Charisma saving throw against that, which halves the damage on success. The heal is now triple instead of double the damage, if, after receiving the damage, the caster still has 50% or more of their HP left. The caster cannot benefit from this effect when targeting himself with the heal.
+ **Lightning Arrow:** now functions simply as a "fireball", just smaller and lightning themed. And involves a ranged attack action. Now has no concentration, so 1 shot = 1 spell slot, and it deals less damage, but has a slightly bigger radius and the targets that fail the save are dazed for 1 r
+ **Magic Circle:** the component is consumed and depends on the targeted race:
  - celestials: blood of a humanoid killed within 24 hours, or [(100gp) garnet, black ore or doomstone dust]
  - elementals: (100gp) peridot dust
  - fey: (100gp) aventurine or diaspore dust
  - fiends (demons): holy water or (50gp) beryl dust
  - undead: holy water or (50gp) moonstone dust
+ **Major Image:** no more concentration; changed scaling: double the duration / SL above 3rd (so the formula is: 10min * 2^(SL-3) )
+ **Mass Healing Word:** removed
+ **Melf's Minute Meteors:** renamed to "Minute Meteors", damage die changed to Xd8
+ **Phantom Steed:** added scaling: +1h duration / SL above 3rd
+ **Protection from Energy:** only lasts 10 min, but doesn't require concentration now; now allows to choose any elemental energy; added scaling: +1 target crea / SL above 3rd
+ **Slow:** the condition applied to the creatures is now known as "slowed"
+ **Speak with Dead:** renamed to "Speak with the Dead"; now requires concentration
+ **Spirit Guardians:** the damage type is based on the deity; can also be ethereal now
+ **Summon Lesser Demons:** no more concentration; you get to choose where to summon the demons from (Hell, Abyss, Void - infernal demons are by default hostile to everything, and void demons are by default neutral towards everything). You might now make an Intimidation check against the infernal demons, or a Persuasion check against the void demons. On a success, the infernal demons will be hostile only against everyone but you and creatures of your choice, and the void demons will be neutral only towards everyone but creatures of your choice. Using garnet dust or having a doomstone also allows you to make sure the demons will not attack you. Having a doomstone gives you advantage on the check as well.
+ **Thunder Step:** you get to choose whether you want the damage to be dealt around your previous location or around the target point
+ **Tidal Wave:** fire elementals receive additional 4d8 cold damage
+ **Tongues:** removed
+ **Wall of Sand:** the creature is also *slowed* within the wall's area (but the movement speed is still down to a third, not half) and also takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per turn.
+ **Wall of Water:** it also deals 2d8 cold damage per turn and requires a successful Con save to pass through it. Fire elementals take 5d8 damage instead and have disadvantage on the save.
+ **Wind Wall:** renamed to "Wall of Wind"; now it deals Force damage instead of Blunt and pushes the creatures out of its area when appearing, and later requires a Strength save in order to pass through it.

# 4th level

+ **Banishment:** Only works on creatures that are from a *different* plane. You can't banish somebody from their home, you're not the goverment. Unless you are, in which case you don't need this spell anyway
+ **Charm Monster:** the creature has to make another Wisdom saving throw in the end, in order to realize it's been charmed
+ **Compulsion:** no more concentration, although if you try to control more than one creature simultaneously like that, each of them gets advantage on the saves against this spell
+ **Cone of Cold:** is now level 4 rather than 5
+ **Conjure Knowbot:** renamed to *Conjure Program*; can now be cast as a ritual; it creates a program that is installed onto a device. It can effectively execute tasks in the system it resides in on your behalf and provide you (over the telepathic link) with the output it receives.
+ **Conjure Minor Elementals:** renamed to "Summon Minor Elementals"; no more concentration; as a component you can use 25 gp dust of a gem related to the elements of the elementals that you are summoning
+ **Conjure Woodland Beings:** renamed to "Summon Woodland Beings"; no more concentration
+ **Control Water:** no more concentration
+ **Elemental Bane:** no more concentration; clarification: you can bane the same target with respect to multiple elements at the same time - every element will count as a separate effect
+ **Evard's Black Tentacles:** renamed to "Black Tentacles"
+ **Fabricate:** whenever fabricating anything, you make a Craftsmanship check to see if you are able to do so
+ **Find Greater Steed:** same changes as for Find Steed, except of course the mount summoned with this spell has better stats.
+ **Fire Shield:** renamed to "Energy Shield"
+ **Guardian of Faith:** the damage now depends on your deity - radiant, ethereal or necrotic
+ **Guardian of Nature:** transforming into the Great Tree increases your size category by 1 tier (for example: Medium -> Large). It no longer gives you advantage on Dexterity based attacks, but your hit dice increase by 1 tier (for example: d8 -> d10).
+ **Leomund's Secret Chest:** renamed to "Ethereal Storage"
+ **Mordekainen's Faithful Hound:** renamed to "Ethereal Guardian"; it can assume a form of various kinds of creatures, the default one being a human-like elemental that wields a sword and deals slashing damage. The warning it gives in that form is just an ominous command to leave. It also no longer disappears when you move far away from it and it will cast a sending spell to you whenever somebody or something tries to pass by it, is killed by it or successfuly passes by (unless they provide the password). Added scaling: it lasts 24h on 5th level, 3 days on 6th level, 7 days on 7th level, a month on 8th level and 6 months on 9th level. Unfortunately, it now also requires a costly material component that is consumed and has a casting time of 10 minutes - it sees you construct a circle with emerald dust.
+ **Mordekainen's Private Sanctum:** renamed to *Arcane Sanctum*
+ **Otiluke's Resilient Sphere:** renamed to *Enclosing Sphere*
+ **Shadow of Moil:** renamed to *Shadows of Demise*; the darkness has the effects of the spell *Darkness*, except at 4th level
+ **Sickening Radiance:** clarification: yes, the exhaustion levels do stack on top of each other.
+ **Staggering Smite:** merged with attack; no more concentration
+ **Stone Shape:** you can also use it to deal 6d12 force damage to a stone construct
+ **Stoneskin:** no more concentration; gives resistance to *all* physical (slashing, piercing, bludgeoning/blunt) damage, not just non-magical
+ **Storm Sphere:** initial damage is now 4d8 lightning damage
+ **Summon Greater Demons:** no more concentration; you can attempt to dismiss the demon at any time - if it succeeds on a Charisma save, it will only go away after 1d6 rounds; using garnet dust or having a doomstone makes sure the demon doesn't attack you; having a doomstone gives the demon disadvantage on Charisma saves against this spell.

# 5th Level

* **Animate Objects:** the stats of the creatures now scale, with +1 AC, attack and damage per SL, and also +1-5 HP depending on the size tier (from Tiny up to Huge); the duration is now 10 min instead of 1 min
* **Banishing Smite:** concentration now optional, merged with attack action; now the banishment threshold is 100 rather than 50
* **Bibgy's Hand:** renamed to *Arcane Hand*; Interposing Hand's Strength now scales
* **Circle of Power:** renamed to *Circle of Protection*
* **Cloudkill:** Radius increased from 20 ft to 40 ft
* **Cone of Cold:** Is now level 4 rather than 5
* **Conjure Elemental:** Renamed to *Summon Elemental;* now Light and Darkness elementals can also be summoned; no more concentration; as a component you can use 25 gp dust of a gem related to the elements of the elementals that you are summoning; the duration time now varies on the casting time - 1 action casting => 1 min duration, 1 min casting => 1 hour duration; basically, see book on this one - there have been a lot of minor changes
* **Conjure Volley:** Renamed to *Shadow Volley*; damage increased from 8d8 to 9d8; can also duplicate magical ammunition and thrown weapons now - the magical effects just don't get cloned
* **Conjure Vrock:** Renamed to *Summon Horror*; no more concentration; now requires a garnet, not just any gem as a component; if a doomstone is used instead, the caster has advantage on the Charisma checks; the horror cannot be "bribed" after going rogue, it just stays this way
* **Contagion:** The effect now beigns immediately, rather than after 3 failed saves; Flesh Rot now gives vulnerability only to physical (slashing, piercing and bludgeoning) damage; Slimy Doom doesn't stun anymore - instead it deals 2d6 necrotic damage at the end of the target's every turn, and halves the target's movement speed
* **Control Winds:** Ranged attacks that are made through a gust in the same direction as the wind if the wind is moderate or strong, are made with a +2 attack bonus; updrafts make it so that falling creatures take no fall damage at all, landing safely instead; you can also use your reaction to change the effect
* **Creation:** It's clarified that such an object must be created on the ground, to prevent 8 500 ton gold meteors being conjured in the sky
* **Danse Macabre:** No more concentration; the undead now receive bonus HP equal to spellcasting modifier * the number of their HD

* **Dream:** A bunch of small changes - see book
* **Enervation:** Damage increased from 4d8 to 6d8; the spell now has initial range of 90 feet, but to preserve it, the target must be within 60 feet; the concentration is now optional; taking actions other than re-applying the spell's effect no longer break the spell
* **Flame Strike:** Range increased from 60 ft to 90 ft, radius increased from 10 ft to 15 ft
* **Geas:** The base duration tweaked to 28 days down from 30 days; now cannot be broken by *Remove Curse*, but can be broken by *Mind Blank*; moreover, it can only be broken by *Greater Restoration* if it's cast at the same or higher level as *Geas*
* **Greater Restoration:** Updated with respect to *Geas* change
* **Hold Monster:** Is now a Cha save rather than Wis
* **Immolation:** No more concentration; duration changed to 30 seconds from 1 min
* **Infernal Calling:** No more concentration; now summons a demon rather than a devil (no difference there in the Northland setting); now requires a garnet, not ruby as a component; if a doomstone is used instead, the caster has advantage on all checks against the demon; this spell now brings the demon permanently, granting it a one-time ability to return back to Hell, and the component gem now glows until the demon either opts to do so, or is forcefully banished - until that happens, you cannot call another demon with this spell; the caster can re-cast this spell at that the previously called demon, demanding that it departs, which the demon can prevent with a successful Charisma saving throw; the talisman variant now requires a written pact instead
* **Insect Plague:** Radius increased from 20 ft to 30 ft
* **Maelstrom:** Duration increased from 1 min to 10 min; if it's cast on a reservoire of water big enough to contain the entire area, the damage DT is increased from d6 to d12; added scaling of +d6 damage and +5 ft radius / spell slot level; a successful save now halves the damage rather than nullifying it completely
* **Mass Cure Wounds:** The heal increased from 3d8 + mod to 5d8 + mod. The scaling increased from 1d8 / SL to (1d8 + mod) / SL. Can also target undead now, in which case they can Con save to halve the damage. The dealt damage is true.
* **Modify Memory:** The target is now dazed on a partial save.
* **Negative Energy Flood**: Added scaling of +1d12 / SL above 5th. The temporary hit points boost for undead targets is now **the** total, rather than half of it.
* **Planar Binding:** Duration scaling changed to better fit the N:1300 calendar. The target is now restrained on a partial save. Fey can no longer be a target and the type of the component gemstone depends on the type of the creature.
* **Rary's Telepathic Bond:** Renamed to *Telepathic Bond*. Added duration scaling.
* **Shutdown:** Now also affects electronic creatures. Added quadratic scaling for the range or duration (caster's choice) and additional power buffs at 8th and 9th levels.
* **Swift Quiver:** A thematic change.
* **Telekinesis:** Added a partial save mechanic (1 round slow).
* **Wall of Force:** The ways to destroy it are flipped. It can now be dispelled by dispel magic, but cannot be destroyed with a disintegrate spell. Added an area scaling.
