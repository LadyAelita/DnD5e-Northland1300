# 4th level

+ **Banishment:** Only works on creatures that are from a *different* plane. You can't banish somebody from their home, you're not the goverment. Unless you are, in which case you don't need this spell anyway
+ **Charm Monster:** the creature has to make another Wisdom saving throw in the end, in order to realize it's been charmed
+ **Compulsion:** no more concentration, although if you try to control more than one creature simultaneously like that, each of them gets advantage on the saves against this spell
+ **Cone of Cold:** is now level 4 rather than 5
+ **Conjure Knowbot:** renamed to *Conjure Program*; can now be cast as a ritual; it creates a program that is installed onto a device. It can effectively execute tasks in the system it resides in on your behalf and provide you (over the telepathic link) with the output it receives.
+ **Conjure Minor Elementals:** renamed to "Summon Minor Elementals"; no more concentration; as a component you can use 25 gp dust of a gem related to the elements of the elementals that you are summoning
+ **Conjure Woodland Beings:** renamed to "Summon Woodland Beings"; no more concentration
+ **Control Water:** no more concentration
+ **Elemental Bane:** no more concentration; clarification: you can bane the same target with respect to multiple elements at the same time - every element will count as a separate effect
+ **Evard's Black Tentacles:** renamed to "Black Tentacles"
+ **Fabricate:** whenever fabricating anything, you make a Craftsmanship check to see if you are able to do so
+ **Find Greater Steed:** same changes as for Find Steed, except of course the mount summoned with this spell has better stats.
+ **Fire Shield:** renamed to "Energy Shield"
+ **Guardian of Faith:** the damage now depends on your deity - radiant, ethereal or necrotic
+ **Guardian of Nature:** transforming into the Great Tree increases your size category by 1 tier (for example: Medium -> Large). It no longer gives you advantage on Dexterity based attacks, but your hit dice increase by 1 tier (for example: d8 -> d10).
+ **Leomund's Secret Chest:** renamed to "Ethereal Storage"
+ **Mordekainen's Faithful Hound:** renamed to "Ethereal Guardian"; it can assume a form of various kinds of creatures, the default one being a human-like elemental that wields a sword and deals slashing damage. The warning it gives in that form is just an ominous command to leave. It also no longer disappears when you move far away from it and it will cast a sending spell to you whenever somebody or something tries to pass by it, is killed by it or successfuly passes by (unless they provide the password). Added scaling: it lasts 24h on 5th level, 3 days on 6th level, 7 days on 7th level, a month on 8th level and 6 months on 9th level. Unfortunately, it now also requires a costly material component that is consumed and has a casting time of 10 minutes - it sees you construct a circle with emerald dust.
+ **Mordekainen's Private Sanctum:** renamed to *Arcane Sanctum*
+ **Otiluke's Resilient Sphere:** renamed to *Enclosing Sphere*
+ **Shadow of Moil:** renamed to *Shadows of Demise*; the darkness has the effects of the spell *Darkness*, except at 4th level
+ **Sickening Radiance:** clarification: yes, the exhaustion levels do stack on top of each other.
+ **Staggering Smite:** merged with attack; no more concentration
+ **Stone Shape:** you can also use it to deal 6d12 force damage to a stone construct
+ **Stoneskin:** no more concentration; gives resistance to *all* physical (slashing, piercing, bludgeoning/blunt) damage, not just non-magical
+ **Storm Sphere:** initial damage is now 4d8 lightning damage
+ **Summon Greater Demons:** no more concentration; you can attempt to dismiss the demon at any time - if it succeeds on a Charisma save, it will only go away after 1d6 rounds; using garnet dust or having a doomstone makes sure the demon doesn't attack you; having a doomstone gives the demon disadvantage on Charisma saves against this spell.

# 5th Level

* **Animate Objects:** the stats of the creatures now scale, with +1 AC, attack and damage per SL, and also +1-5 HP depending on the size tier (from Tiny up to Huge); the duration is now 10 min instead of 1 min
* **Banishing Smite:** concentration now optional, merged with attack action; now the banishment threshold is 100 rather than 50
* **Bibgy's Hand:** renamed to *Arcane Hand*; Interposing Hand's Strength now scales
* **Circle of Power:** renamed to *Circle of Protection*
* **Cloudkill:** Radius increased from 20 ft to 40 ft
* **Cone of Cold:** Is now level 4 rather than 5
* **Conjure Elemental:** Renamed to *Summon Elemental;* now Light and Darkness elementals can also be summoned; no more concentration; as a component you can use 25 gp dust of a gem related to the elements of the elementals that you are summoning; the duration time now varies on the casting time - 1 action casting => 1 min duration, 1 min casting => 1 hour duration; basically, see book on this one - there have been a lot of minor changes
* **Conjure Volley:** Renamed to *Shadow Volley*; damage increased from 8d8 to 9d8; can also duplicate magical ammunition and thrown weapons now - the magical effects just don't get cloned
* **Conjure Vrock:** Renamed to *Summon Horror*; no more concentration; now requires a garnet, not just any gem as a component; if a doomstone is used instead, the caster has advantage on the Charisma checks; the horror cannot be "bribed" after going rogue, it just stays this way
* **Contagion:** The effect now beigns immediately, rather than after 3 failed saves; Flesh Rot now gives vulnerability only to physical (slashing, piercing and bludgeoning) damage; Slimy Doom doesn't stun anymore - instead it deals 2d6 necrotic damage at the end of the target's every turn, and halves the target's movement speed
* **Control Winds:** Ranged attacks that are made through a gust in the same direction as the wind if the wind is moderate or strong, are made with a +2 attack bonus; updrafts make it so that falling creatures take no fall damage at all, landing safely instead; you can also use your reaction to change the effect
* **Creation:** It's clarified that such an object must be created on the ground, to prevent 8 500 ton gold meteors being conjured in the sky
* **Danse Macabre:** No more concentration; the undead now receive bonus HP equal to spellcasting modifier * the number of their HD
* **Destructive Wave:** One must now specify at character creation whether they want to always deal radiant or necrotic damage
* **Dispel Evil and Good:** Renamed to Dispel Evil *or* Good; see Updated-Rules.pdf
* **Dominate Person:** No more concentration; is now a Charisma save rather than Wisdom
* **Dream:** A bunch of small changes - see book
* **Enervation:** Damage increased from 4d8 to 6d8; the spell now has initial range of 90 feet, but to preserve it, the target must be within 60 feet; the concentration is now optional; taking actions other than re-applying the spell's effect no longer break the spell
* **Flame Strike:** Range increased from 60 ft to 90 ft, radius increased from 10 ft to 15 ft
* **Geas:** The base duration tweaked to 28 days down from 30 days; now cannot be broken by *Remove Curse*, but can be broken by *Mind Blank*; moreover, it can only be broken by *Greater Restoration* if it's cast at the same or higher level as *Geas*
* **Greater Restoration:** Updated with respect to *Geas* change
* **Hold Monster:** Is now a Cha save rather than Wis
* **Immolation:** No more concentration; duration changed to 30 seconds from 1 min
* **Infernal Calling:** No more concentration; now summons a demon rather than a devil (no difference there in the Northland setting); now requires a garnet, not ruby as a component; if a doomstone is used instead, the caster has advantage on all checks against the demon; this spell now brings the demon permanently, granting it a one-time ability to return back to Hell, and the component gem now glows until the demon either opts to do so, or is forcefully banished - until that happens, you cannot call another demon with this spell; the caster can re-cast this spell at that the previously called demon, demanding that it departs, which the demon can prevent with a successful Charisma saving throw; the talisman variant now requires a written pact instead
* **Insect Plague:** Radius increased from 20 ft to 30 ft
* **Maelstrom:** Duration increased from 1 min to 10 min; if it's cast on a reservoire of water big enough to contain the entire area, the damage DT is increased from d6 to d12; added scaling of +d6 damage and +5 ft radius / spell slot level; a successful save now halves the damage rather than nullifying it completely
* **Mass Cure Wounds:** The heal increased from 3d8 + mod to 5d8 + mod. The scaling increased from 1d8 / SL to (1d8 + mod) / SL. Can also target undead now, in which case they can Con save to halve the damage. The dealt damage is true.
* **Modify Memory:** The target is now dazed on a partial save.
* **Negative Energy Flood**: Added scaling of +1d12 / SL above 5th. The temporary hit points boost for undead targets is now **the** total, rather than half of it.
* **Planar Binding:** Duration scaling changed to better fit the N:1300 calendar. The target is now restrained on a partial save. Fey can no longer be a target and the type of the component gemstone depends on the type of the creature.
* **Rary's Telepathic Bond:** Renamed to *Telepathic Bond*. Added duration scaling.
* **Shutdown:** Now also affects electronic creatures. Added quadratic scaling for the range or duration (caster's choice) and additional power buffs at 8th and 9th levels.
* **Swift Quiver:** A thematic change.
* **Telekinesis:** Added a partial save mechanic (1 round slow).
* **Wall of Force:** The ways to destroy it are flipped. It can now be dispelled by dispel magic, but cannot be destroyed with a disintegrate spell. Added an area scaling.
* **Wall of Light:** Damage increased to 5d8.
* **Wall of Stone:** Added thickness and area scaling.
* **Wrath of Nature:** Added cube side length scaling of +20 ft / SL above 5th.
