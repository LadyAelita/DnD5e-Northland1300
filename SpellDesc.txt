1st level:
Absorb Elements - Receive resistance for 1 round from one element. Optionally concentrate for up to 2 rounds. If you do so, your next attack (be it melee, ranged, spell, w/e) deals +2d6 of the same damage type (NOT the roll result, but the lowest number between the roll result and dealt damage).
