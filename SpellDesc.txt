1st level:
Absorb Elements - Receive resistance for 1 round from one element. Optionally concentrate for up to 2 rounds. If you do so, your next attack (be it melee, ranged, spell, w/e) deals +2d6 of the same damage type.
Armor of Agathys - renamed to Armor of the Abyss
Arms of Hadar - renamed to Arms of Legion
Bane - subtract d6 now instead of d4
Burning Hands - cones suck, so instead of looking for tiles that have more than 50% of themselves covered by the cone, let's assume that the cover percentage being higher than 0% is enough for the tile to be affected
Cause Fear - no more concentration
Ceremony:
	- Bless Water: Holy water blessed by a cleric of a given deity can be used by any of the said deity's followers to attempt and bless something or someone in a minute long ritual. A cleric will automatically succeed, providing the target with the effect of the Bless spell for a day. A non-cleric will have a 50% + 5*(Wisdom modifier)% chance without knowing the result up until the bonus would come into play. In case an item is targeted, it might receive a random small permanent enchantment. The effects of this don't stack.
	- Curse Water [NEW]: One can also conjure unholy water in a similar manner. Instead of applying Bless, it will apply Bane, and instead of creating helpful enchanted items, it will create cursed ones.
	- Coming of Age: Can only be cast on the day of the target's actual coming of age (the age is determined by the cleric's religion, and if it's not, then it's up to the local tradition). Instead of giving the d4 bonus, it increases all of the target's abilities by 1 permanently.
	- Dedication: The target also gains proficiency in Religion, provided that you have it already as well.
	- Wedding: They don't get +2 to AC for the next 7 days, but they get +1 to AC permanently instead (the condition remains the same). This bonus is removed when the marriage ends by whatever means.
Charm Person - they don't know about having been charmed, unless they succeed on a second Wisdom save at the end of the effect.
Comprehend Languages - fuck that shit! It's still level 1, BUT now if you want to achieve the actual previous effect, you have to cast it at level 9 - the lower the spell slot level, the more Google Translator cycles will the message go through to make it more unclear. It will also only last 10 minutes and require concentration now.
Create or Destroy water - the school is Conjuration (Creation) for create and Transmutation for destroy
Cure Wounds - you can try to melee touch attack an undead, so that they get damaged instead. The dealt damage is technically negative necrotic damage, but it's described as true for the sake of simplicity and in order for it not to be affected by vulnerabilities and immunities.
Detect Evil and Good - changed to Detect Evil *or* Good. Look Updated-Rules.pdf. It's also a ritual now
Ensnaring Strike - no more concentration
Entangle - area increased to 30 ft; now applies to all visible creatures of choice in the area
Expeditious Retreat - now allows to either do a Dash *or a Disengage* as a bonus action
False Life - the base is now 2d6 + your spellcasting mod, rather than 1d6 + 4, but it only lasts a minute now
Find Familiar - now it will allow for a broader selection of familiars - including elementals, demons etc. (albeit all of them will still be shite and have 0 CR. I mean, c'mon, what did you expect?). A final list of eligible creatures doesn't exist. A short one with some examples will be provided, but your character can still possibly gain knowledge of other creatures not mentioned on said list. Moreover, you can no longer dismiss your familiar to a "pocket plane". You can however dismiss them back to their original plane, but then you have to resummon them.
Flow of Magic - has scaling; the target creature receives a temporary spell slot of one level higher than the level this spell was cast at; the slot can be used within 1 round and then it disappears
Fog Cloud - no more concentration
Healing Word - you might now target undead as well. They don't get no saves if you do so
Jump - added scaling: you can target an additional creature for every SL above 1st; also increased the range to 60 ft
Protection from Evil and Good: Welcome to the 5th edition of D||D (Dungeons or Dragons) once again! Renamed to Protection from Evil *or* Good; see Updated-Rules.pdf; Also, added scaling: can target +1 crea/SL above 1st.
Ray of Sickness: no longer allows for a save. If you hit, you hit the entire effect. It's also one of those Touch AC spells now and is Xd10 instead of Xd8, so it doesn't suck anymore
Searing Smite: now it is merged with the melee attack action. If you hit that attack, *then* you may *optionally* concentrate to keep the fire up. Would have maybe increased the dmg, but it's a Paladin-exclusive, so there is no need to buff those
Shield: being a shield, it also now increases the touch AC *and* Dex saves. If you didn't take this spell after this change, immediatly commit suicide and create a new character to fix this
Shield of Faith: no more concentration; it also increasess the touch AC and Dex saves as well
Soil Food and Drink: the opposite of Purify Food and Drink - corrupts food and drink in the target area, rendering it useless and generally bad for one's health
Tasha's Hideous Laughter: Renamed to *Hideous Laughter*
Tenser's Floating Disk: Renamed to *Floating Disk*
Thunderous Smite: no more concentration, merged with attack action
Thunderwave: is now a radius rather than a cube
Witch Bolt: now is one of the Touch AC spells; the scaling now increases not just the initial, but the reocurring damage as well
Wrathful Smite: merged with attack, concentration optional; added scaling: +1d6 dmg/SL above 1st
Zephyr Strike: if the enhanced attack + faster movement bonus is utilized immediatly, the spell doesn't require concentration but also doesn't last longer than 1 round

2nd level:
Aganazzar's Scorcher: renamed to "Blazing Burst"
Alter Self: no more concentration
Branding Smite: merged with attack, optional concentration
Calm Emotions: now also provides the targets with advantage on Composure checks
Cloud of Daggers: the cloud can now also make an unlimited number of opportunity attacks per turn, using your spell attack bonus against the target's normal AC. It has a reach of 5 ft. Moreover, you can use your bonus action to move the cloud by 15 ft.
Darkness: the caster can see normally through the darkness they have created with this spell; if the overlapping light spell is of level equal to Darkness, both are dispelled; if it's smaller than Darkness, then only that spell is dispelled, not Darkness; added scaling: radius +10 ft/SL above 2nd
Dragon's Breath: now if you target yourself, you can optionally not concentrate, but then you have to use the effect in the same round the spell was cast
Dust Devil: the space doesn't have to be unoccupied now. The creature that's standing on the point of origin is pushed 15 ft in a random direction on failed save, or into an unocuppied space of their choice within 5 ft of the origin on a successful one
Earthbind: rather than fallng slowly, the creature rapidly descends at a constant velocity of 50 ft per second, which is 300 ft per round. Given how the range is 300 ft, it will always reach the ground below it by the end of the round (unless some metamagic is utilized). As a result, it takes 4d6 fall damage on impact. The damage has a scaling of +2d6/SL above 2nd, except 8th level gets 17d6, and 9th gets 20d6. The concentraion on this spell is optional. If your target still hasn't reached the ground, the concentration will cause it to keep falling. If it's on the ground as a result of the fall, the concentration will cause it to become and remain slowed and grounded [NEW CONDITIONS]. If the ground level below the target is very low and it would out of your sight by the end of the round, you either cannot begin the concentration, or your concentration is broken.
Enthrall: Now requires concentration; the targets are now charmed as well. When one of the targets is attacked or receives any damage, the spell ends for that target. The other targets then get another chance at the Wisdom save.
Find Steed: now has material components that are consumed; You can now summon an animal that's not on the list if the DM agrees to that creature. Your steed's race can now also be undead or an elemental and its language is based on the race - infernal for demons, celestial for celestials, venefical for fey, the related elemental language for an elemental and black speech for undead. Your steed also no longer gets hit by spells targeted at you by default. However, when your steed drops to 0 hit points, it dies instead of disappearing. Moreover, dismissing and resummoning the stead will not heal it immediatly - one has to wait a day before the resummoning for that to happen.
Gentle Response: renamed to "Peaceful Rest"
Healing Spirit: the spirit can now target undead to deal damage to them rather than heal. In that case, it attempts a touch attack using your spell attack bonus.
